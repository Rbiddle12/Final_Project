The Game Starts once the program is run
The monster is randomly chosen from a pool of 4
The monster is merely cosmetic for now
You can Attack or Defend
Defending takes the turn but halfs damage taken
Attacking deals Damage but has no damage reduction on your end
To Defend type in Defend or defend 
To Attack type in Attack or attack 
If you make a typo or mess up, the Monster's turn is skipped
You get the choice of a weapon
Weapons can buff damage along with change gameplay
If the a weapon isn't chosen then it defaults to a normal attack and defend without weapon buffs
